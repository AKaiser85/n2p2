#Example of usage
#new training set size "20", memory intensive "0"
mpirun -np 1 nnp-fpssampling 20 0 > output

#Example of usage
#new training set size "50", memory saving "1"
#mpirun -np 1 nnpf-fpssampling 50 1 > output

#For very large trainingsets, memory saving is the only working route. It recalculates symmetry functions many times. The code may be optimized a lot in this mode.
#Note that there is no memory overload control and the program will just stop with an undefined error message in case of memory overload
#This application is not yet parallelized
